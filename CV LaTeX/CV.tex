\begin{itemize}

\item{\textbf{Masters Project:} \textit{'Linear Stability Analysis for Plane Poiseuille flow'}

\vspace{3pt}

\small{As a first step to determine the stability of a fluid flow problem, one often supposes that the perturbations to the basic state are of very small amplitude, which allows for a linearisation of the equations. Although this is a strong assumption, linear stability analysis has proven useful in many flow configurations - the stability of a plane channel flow has been analyzed.}} \newline

\item{\textbf{Masters Project:}} \textit{'Lattice Boltzmann Method'}

\small{This report involved simulations for a Lid-Driven Cavity and the Kármán Vortex Street. Different code adaptions had to be made and several test cases have been carried out. } \newline

\section{Thesis}
\vspace{3pt}

\subsection{Bachelor of Science with focus on "Construction and Validation of Mechanical Constructions"}

\vspace{3pt}

\textbf{Title:} Investigation of the modelling of real, technical surfaces \newline

\textbf{Supervisor:} Dipl.-Ing. Stefan Reichert (IPEK Karlsruhe) \newline

\textbf{Description:} Analysis of statistical roughness parameters of numerical generated surfaces. The finite element software Abaqus was used to import topographies generated with a Matlab script allowing a contact simulation between two surfaces. An automatic report generator has been written showing the change of the so called Abbott-Firestone curve.

\vspace{6pt}

\subsection{Master of Science with focus on "Fluid Mechanics \& Computational Mechanics"}

\vspace{3pt}

\textbf{Title:} Predictive Maintenance and XAI (no specific title chosen yet) - Finished April-May 2020 \newline

\textbf{Supervisor:} Nadia Burkart (Frauenhofer IOSB Karlsruhe) \newline

\textbf{Description:} Data driven prognostic systems enable us to send out an early warning of the machine failure in order to reduce the cost of failures and maintenance and to improve the management of the maintenance schedule. The goal will be moving towards a transparent and unverstandable (white-box) model which can be applied on critic applications such as within the manufacturing industry.
